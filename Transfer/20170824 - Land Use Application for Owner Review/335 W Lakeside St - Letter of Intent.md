Dear Plan Commission,

The owners of 325 West Lakeside Street, Bonnie & Jerry Thiel, are seeking a conditional use approval relative to *Sec. 28.151(f) - Dwelling Units in Mixed-Use Buildings.*  Specifically, this proposal is requesting a reduction of the first floor footprint of a non-residential use from the required 75%, down to 61%.

A number of years ago, the city had lowered the elevation of Rowell street along the west side of the building.  As a result, the two car garage on the south side of the first floor commercial tenant, was rendered inaccessible. In order to re-utilize the garage in some fashion, the owners renovated the space into a studio apartment.

At the time they were unaware that the renovation required a permit, however, due to their desire to renovate the apartment again, they are requesting that this existing residential unit would be allowed to infringe slightly on the 75% minimum requirement of a non-residential area.  In other words, 61% of the 1st floor would be allocated to existing commercial, and the remaining 39%, allocated to the existing residential unit.

As the public interest is concerned, due to the fact that this first floor residence has been existing for a number of years, it is speculated there will no additional burden to the interests of the surrounding community.

In addition, this application proposes the introduction of (4) bike stalls--(2) for the commercial unit to the north and (2) for the (3) residential units on the 1st and 2nd floors.

Thank you for your consideration,
